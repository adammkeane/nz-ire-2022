# Ireland's 2022 Rugby Tour of New Zealand

This website aims to provide a convenient place to find all the relevant info about Irelands's 2022 rugby tour of New Zealand. I found that I was searching for a few different wesbites to find the information about the tour, so this website aims to bring all the sites I wanted into one place. Hopefully, others will also find the sites I looked for of interest to them.
